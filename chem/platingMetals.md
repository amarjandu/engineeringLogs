# Background
After blasting materials/hardware for classic cars / bikes, it makes sense to protect the material from corrosion. Plating materials with sacrificial points allows us to prevent structural damage to components, and ensures the longevity of materials.

If you dont wanna do it then just stay keep cleaning.





## Cleaning / Prep
There has to be stages of cleaning to get the material prepped in order for the plating to bond correctly, it also reduces the blemishes within the material.

* Acid Bath
    * Physical Cleaning (Polish Wheel/Tumbler)
    * 
* Chemical Prep

## Plating Process

Create a clean bath for the solution of;
* 30 parts Zinc Chloride
* 120 parts ammonium chloride
* 1000 parts h2o
* 5% final solution weight of glycol (anti-freeze)

You'll have to be using ~0.05 amps/sqInch of material ( this will effect the time that the material is exposed in the solution)

Colour finishing is required after this process is complete, this gives us that baller finish that we wanna have so we can stunt on other kids.

This tends to be the finish that we are after for car, it looks the cleanest, and when all the hardware matches, it causes a good amount of pop, really changes the engine bay.
